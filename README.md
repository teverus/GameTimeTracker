# Game Time Tracker

A CLI application to track time you've spent in a game.

## Purpose

If you play games on **_platforms that do not track time_**, 
but you really want to **_know how much time you've spent in a game_**, this is the right app for you!

## User scenario
1. Write down game `name` and it's `process` in `config.yml` as shown in the example
2. Double click `START_ME.bat`
3. Leave the application running (minimize the window)
4. Close the application window as needed. _NOTE: If you close the application before the game process was terminated, the time will not be recorded!_

## Limitations
This CLI **_supports Windows only_**. Sorry, Mac and Linux users. You are free to start the code from `main.py` any way you like. However, best user experience is not guaranteed in this case.
